# US Baby Names 2010s Data Analysis Using Python
Project on analyzing data using Python from a US Social Security Administration Dataset on Baby names in the 2010s. The database lists the frequency with which each name has been given to girls and boys in the 2010s.

The below are questions I solve using Python programming:

1.How many total names are listed in the database?
2.How many total births are covered by the names in the database?
3.By default, the Social Security Administration's data separates out names by gender. For example, Jamie is listed separately for girls and for boys. If you were to remove this separation, what would be the most common name in the 2010s regardless of gender?
4.What name that is used for both genders has the smallest difference in which gender holds the name most frequently? In case of a tie, enter any one of the correct answers.
