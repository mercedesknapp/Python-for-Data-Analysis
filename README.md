**Data Analysis Projects Using Python**



A collection of data analysis using Python. I used Jupyter Notebooks & Excel CSV data sets to perform statistical analysis using Python
Below are the current projects I'm working on and will add more! Working on tableau visualizations and will link that in the folders for each as well.

1. Data Analysis of Popular US Baby Names in the 2010s
2. Data Analysis Food Access in TN using USDA data from 2019
