# US Baby Names 2010s Data Analysis Using Python
Project on analyzing data using Python from a US Social Security Administration Dataset on Baby names in the 2010s. The database lists the frequency with which each name has been given to girls and boys in the 2010s.

The below are questions I solve using Python programming:<br>

1.Using Statisistical analysis, I find the total count of names are listed in the database, mean, standard deviation25-75% percentiles, as well as the minimum and maximum count for babies with a specific name <br>
3.By default, the Social Security Administration's data separates out names by gender. For example, Jamie is listed separately for girls and for boys. If you were to remove this separation, what would be the most common name in the 2010s regardless of gender?<br>
4.What name that is used for both genders has the smallest difference in which gender holds the name most frequently? In case of a tie, enter any one of the correct answers.

I also use pyplot from mathplotlib to perform the following Data Visualization:
1. Visualize outliers using a boxplot and remove outliers using Z-scores
2. A bar chart for the Top 10 Baby Names by Number of Babies with that name
3. Create a bar chart for the names with the least number of babies with that name
